## Assignment Overview

The goal of this assignment is to build an **n-gram-based language model** with multiple variations. You will need to:
1. Develop models using n-grams.
2. Perform error analysis to understand the model's advantages and drawbacks.
3. Clearly explain your choices regarding the data structures, algorithms, and approaches used.

## Key Requirements

- **Report**: The report is a crucial part of the submission. It should clearly articulate:
  - What you did.
  - Why you did it.
  - How you implemented your solution (including details about the data structures used).
- The report should be concise and well-organized. Avoid excess verbiage and ambiguity.
- Error analysis should be comprehensive and highlight key strengths and weaknesses of the models you built.
- Use the provided LATEX template or any preferred writing tool (e.g., Google Docs or Microsoft Word).

## Submission

The final submission will be made through **Gradescope**, and should include:
- The implementation code for the language models.
- The report detailing your approach, results, and analysis.
